# Soft-Robot-Evolution
CPPN Evolutionary Algorithum:

Before each robot is constructed, a 3D voxel map is made. Each voxel is then transformed into a cube that is connected with the surrounding cubes. 
Mathimatical functions with parameters x, y, and z "f(xyz)" represented as a binary expression tree are then evolved in populations using crossover.
The resulting expressions are then evaluated at each spring to determine their properties. each property, including if the cube even exsists, has its own equation
within each robot.
[Here](https://www.instagram.com/p/CYnXiXpqGZr/) are some examples of what was produced.
